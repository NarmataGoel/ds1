(a) n=no of row = no. of columns 
 space required for diagonal matrix = n

 (b)space for diagonal =n 
 space for below elements = n-1;
 space for above elements = n-1 
 so total space required for tri-diagonal matrix is : 3n-1 


 (c) 
 space for lower triangular matrix = n(n+1)/2

 (d) space for upper triangular matrix = n(n+1)/2

 (e) here arr[i][j]=arr[j][i] so here we need either to store lower diagonal elements or upper diagonal elements 
 so space required = n(n+1)/2
